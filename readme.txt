== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Can I use this plugin without an account on heatmap.me**

No, this plugin is mostly a wrapper to simplify the installation and the use of HeatMap's technology. Though, there is an upside: we are using powerful servers and technologies to offer a product that would slow down your WordPress sites if we tried to integrate it as a standalone plugin. Plus, there is a free plan, so why bother?

**I don't see my clicks when I play with my own site**

To prevent your clicks from polluting your data, the plugin disables the logging engine when you are logged in as admin on your own site. You can test with a different browser if you don't believe us ;)

**Does the plugin impact the performance of my site?**

No. Our tag is very small and fully asynchronous. Plus, we set up powerful servers and technologies to collect data (we collect hundreds of millions of clicks per month), crunch them and then, display them to you. Finally, the plugin itself stores its configuration using WordPress core engine, so there is no extra load on your WordPress installation.
